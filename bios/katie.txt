This is a very hard question I like basically everything but i love the drunken fried rice from No Thai, I also love street tacos and pizza but it has to be good pizza, not shitty pizza. The pizza at the sny phi dining hall is NOT GOOD and yet I eat it anyway because it is free. The cheesy garlic bread is good though.
